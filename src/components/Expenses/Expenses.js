//note : Do not use indexs as keys
//ou may wonder, why donâ€™t we just use indexes as keys when looping through an array. 
// Although, many developers have done that in their code it is not necessarily ideal
//  React recommends that you do not use indexes as keys,
  // since it could impact performance negatively and could lead to some unstable component behaviour.
